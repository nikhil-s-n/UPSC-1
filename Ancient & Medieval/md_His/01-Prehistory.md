# Pre-History

* PreHistory - Has no written records.
    * Lots of Archaeological Records.
* **Division** of PreHistoric period in India
    1. **Palaeolithic** (Old Stone Age)
    2. **Mesolithic** (Middle Stone Age)
    3. **Neolithic** (New Stone Age)
    4. **Metal Age**
* These periods not uniform throught the subcontinent.
* Dating done through
    * **Radio-carbon dating** - Loss of carbon in organic material over a period of time.
    * **Dendro Chronology** - Number of tree rings in the wood.
